CSC 211 Team Turtle Repo

GIT Repo for CSC 211 2014 at the University of Rochester. This code is done as a model of an application to improve a user's health by monitoring their stress and task management. As such, most back end is faked or simply random.
Uses the Caldroid API for calendar use on all versions of Android. Caldroid can be found on Github here: https://github.com/roomorama/Caldroid.
Compiled with Android 19 (4.4.2)
Earliest Supported: Android 8 (2.2)
Note: No actual data is properly handled and many things are done quick and dirty. This means some life cycle related bugs are not fixed. This is only to provide an actual working UI running with native code on an actual device.
